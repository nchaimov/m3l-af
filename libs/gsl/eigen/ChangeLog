	* hermv.c (gsl_eigen_hermv): fixed index bug in accumulation of evec.

	* symmv.c (gsl_eigen_symmv): fixed index bug in accumulation of evec.

	* test.c (main): added two new test cases

	* qrstep.c (trailing_eigenvalue): chose better value of mu when
 	dt=0, prevents infinite loop.

	*  modified to use new-style vector views

Wed Jun 20 12:30:38 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* hermv.c (gsl_eigen_hermv): additional workspace argument no
 	longer required

Mon Apr 23 10:31:01 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* unified error handling conventions to _e for error handling
 	functions and no suffix for plain functions, so _impl functions
 	are no longer needed.

	* removed tests for EFAULT, since EFAULT should only apply to
 	invalid non-null pointers.

	* eigen/test.c (test_invert_jacobi): removed matmult and replaced
 	by gsl_blas_dgemm
