@cindex GNU General Public License
The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
numerical computing.  The routines have been written from scratch in C,
and present a modern Applications Programming Interface
(API) for C programmers, allowing wrappers to be written for very
high level languages.  The source code is distributed under the GNU
General Public License.

The use of these routines is described in this manual.  Each chapter
provides detailed definitions of the functions, followed by example
programs and references to the articles on which the algorithms are
based.

@node GSL is Free Software
@section GSL is Free Software
@cindex free software, explanation of
The subroutines in the GNU Scientific Library are ``free software'';
this means that everyone is free to use them, and to redistribute them
in other free programs.  The library is not in the public domain; it is
copyrighted and there are conditions on its distribution.  These
conditions are designed to permit everything that a good cooperating
citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed is to try to prevent
others from further sharing any version of the software that they might
get from you.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of any programs related to the GNU Scientific Library, that you
receive their source code or else can get it if you want it, that you
can change these programs or use pieces of them in new free programs,
and that you know you can do these things.  

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of any related code which uses the GNU Scientific Library, you
must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
tell them their rights.  This means that the library should not be
redistributed in proprietary programs.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for the GNU Scientific Library.  If these
programs are modified by someone else and passed on, we want their
recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on our
reputation.

The precise conditions for the distribution of software related to the
GNU Scientific Library are found in the GNU General Public License
(@pxref{GNU General Public License}).  Further information about this
license is available from the GNU Project webpage @cite{Frequently Asked
Questions about the GNU GPL},

@node Obtaining GSL
@section Obtaining GSL
@cindex obtaining GSL
@cindex downloading GSL
@cindex mailing list for GSL announcements
@cindex gsl-announce mailing list
The source code for the library can be obtained in different ways, by
copying it from a friend, purchasing it on @sc{cdrom} or downloading it
from the internet. A list of public ftp servers which carry the source
code can be found on the GNU website,

@itemize @asis
@item 
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/}
@end itemize
@noindent
The preferred platform for the library is a GNU system, which allows it
to take advantage of additional features in the GNU C compiler and GNU C
library.  However, the library is fully portable and compiles on most
Unix platforms. It is also available for Microsoft Windows.  Precompiled
versions of the library can be purchased from commercial redistributors
listed on the website.

Announcements of new releases, updates and other relevant events are
made on the @code{gsl-announce} mailing list.  To subscribe to this
low-volume list, send an email of the following form,

@example

Subject: subscribe

You will receive a response asking to you to reply in order to confirm
your subscription.

@node   An Example Program
@section An Example Program

The following short program demonstrates the use of the library by
computing the value of the Bessel function @math{J_0(x)} for @math{x=5},

@example
#include <stdio.h>
#include <gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h>

int
main (void)
@{
  double x = 5.0;

  double y = gsl_sf_bessel_J0 (x);

  printf("J0(%g) = %.18e\n", x, y);

  return 0;
@}
@end example
@noindent
The output is shown below, and should be correct to double-precision
accuracy,

@example
J0(5) = -1.775967713143382920e-01
@end example
@noindent
The steps needed to compile programs which use the library are described
in the next chapter.
